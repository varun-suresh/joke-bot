# joke-bot

Objectives :

1) Learn Tensorflow
2) Build a bot trained on the jokes dataset and see what the outputs look like.

I'm using [this](https://github.com/taivop/joke-dataset) dataset

Setup
-----
These are the steps to setup a google cloud instance.

1) Sign up [here](https://cloud.google.com/)
2) Go to the console and create a project.
3) Create an instance. Follow the instructions [here](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/connecting-to-instance#sshingcloud)
4) You should now have an instance with a public IP. Use `ssh USERNAME@external_ip ` to ssh into the virtual machine.
